# Primary Key

## The project Idea

This was a mini project I made in college, its main idea is to find the primary key after taking the relation attributes as input in addition to functional dependencies

## Programming Language

Python was selected as the programming language for this project primarily for the purpose of practicing and familiarizing myself with it as a new language. There was no specific technical reason behind this choice.
